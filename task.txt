	Introduction

Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are data structures that power real-time collaborative applications in distributed systems. CRDTs can be replicated across systems, they can be updated independently and concurrently without coordination between the replicas, and it is always mathematically possible to resolve inconsistencies that might result.

	Deliverable

Study LWW-Element-Set, Graph , and implement a state-based LWW-Element-Graph with test cases. Test cases should be clearly written and document what aspect of CRDT they test. We recommend you spend no more than 4 hours on this challenge. The provided readings should be sufficient to understand LWW-Element-Set, Graph, and CRDT on a high level. You are welcome to dig deeper on those but we expect you to come up with the implementation yourself without any help from other open-sourced implementations.

	Grading & Submission

You'll be graded based on code quality, test coverage, documentation, and you can use any language of choice.
